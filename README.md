# STOCK-MOVEMENT-ANALYSIS Major project


This project explores the relationship between social media sentiment and stock price movements. By analyzing large volumes of social media data, such as tweets, posts, and discussions, we aim to identify sentiment patterns that correlate with stock market fluctuations.

# Objectives : 
1. Predicts short-term stock price trends
2. Uses sentiment analysis from Twitter & Reddit
3. Combines VADER, FinBERT, and machine learning models
4. Aims for improved accuracy over traditional methods
5. Social media's rising impact on stock prices (e.g., GameStop)
6. Need for real-time market sentiment insights
7. Traditional methods miss behavioral market triggers
Goal: Smarter, sentiment-driven investment predictions
8. Existing models lack real-time sentiment input
9. Our system integrates social sentiment into stock forecasting
