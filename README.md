# STOCK-MOVEMENT-ANALYSIS Major project


This project explores the relationship between social media sentiment and stock price movements. By analyzing large volumes of social media data, such as tweets, posts, and discussions, we aim to identify sentiment patterns that correlate with stock market fluctuations.

# Objectives : 
Predicts short-term stock price trends
Uses sentiment analysis from Twitter & Reddit
Combines VADER, FinBERT, and machine learning models
Aims for improved accuracy over traditional methods
Social media's rising impact on stock prices (e.g., GameStop)
Need for real-time market sentiment insights
Traditional methods miss behavioral market triggers
Goal: Smarter, sentiment-driven investment predictions
Existing models lack real-time sentiment input
Cannot react to sudden sentiment-driven market changes
Our system integrates social sentiment into stock forecasting
